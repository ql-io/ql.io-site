<p>ql.io can help you reduce number of lines of that you need to write for making API calls while
simultaneously reducing network latency and bandwidth usage in a number of use cases. At eBay we
have seen instances of over 30 times reduction in number of lines of code, 150% reduction in data
size and 60% reduction in number of HTTP requests &#8212; the actual numbers depend on the
deployment topology of the API servers and client apps.</p>

<h2>What can ql.io do?</h2>

<h3>SQL and JSON as a DSL</h3>

<p>SQL is a quite powerful DSL to retrieve, filter,
 project, and join data &#8212; see efforts like <a
href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1961297">A co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared
Data Banks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a>, <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a>, or <a href="http://www.unqlspec.org/">unQL</a> for
examples.</p>

<p>ql.io combines SQL, JSON, and a few procedural style constructs into a compact <a
href="/docs/reference/ql">scripting language</a> &#8212; you can use it to map HTTP's CRUD interface to
SQL and then use SQL and JSON to retrieve data, to perform joins, projections and even loops.
ql.io does not mind if you are using HTTP RESTfully or not &#8212;  it can handle any API that can be
reached over HTTP. You can even offer a HTTP GET based interface to <a href="/docs/post">SOAP
APIs</a> using ql.io.</p>

<h3>Orchestrate Without Pain</h3>

<p>Most real-world client apps need to mashup data from multiple APIs in one go. Data mashup is
often complicated as you need to worry about order of requests, inter-dependencies, error
handling, and parallelization to reduce overall latency.</p>

<p>You don't need a complex multi-threaded fork-join or orchestration framework so solve this.
ql.io knows how to schedule execution of statements asynchronously. You can write procedural
scripts, and let ql.io do the orchestration using async I/O.</p>

<p>A consequence - massive reductions in number of lines of code! See the <a
href="/docs/quickstart">Quick Start Guide</a> to find out yourself.</p>

<h3>Reduce Latency and Bandwidth Use</h3>

<p>APIs are designed for reuse, and hence they cater to the common denominator. Getting new
fields added, optimizing responses, or combining multiple requests into one involve drawn out
negotiations between API producing teams and API consuming teams.</p>

<p>ql.io lets API consuming teams move fast by creating consumer-centric interfaces that are
optimized for the client - this lets you save on bandwidth while reducing latencies.</p>
  
<h3>Cleanse APIs to Improve Interoperability</h3>

<p>Not all APIs are created equal &#8212; inconsistency between APIs is a reality. You may have
RESTful APIs on one end and SOAP on the other and a mixture in between. Working across all those
APIs can cause code bloat. </p>

<p>In stead of waiting for the API owners to agree on consistency and clean their APIs, you can
apply ql.io's <a href="/docs/language">routes</a> to offer new RESTful interfaces that are more
consistent, more conformant to HTTP, and easier to use.</p>

<h2>Quick Installation</h2>

<p>ql.io is built using <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> (requires version 4.x). You can get
started with ql.io in two ways &#8212;  either a stand alone server, or as a part of your node app. To use
ql.io as a stand-alone server with the necessary modules, try </p>

<em>TODO: These step does not work yet.</em>

<pre class="brush: bash">mkdir myapp
cd myapp
curl ..../init.sh | bash
bin/start.sh
</pre>

<p>If you want to use ql.io as part of your node apps so that you can execute your scripts
programmatically, install the core engine directly.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
npm install ql.io-engine
</pre>

<p>See <a href="/docs/node-apps">How to use ql.io in Nodejs apps</a> for details.</p>
