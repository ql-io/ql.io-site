<h1>About ql.io</h1>

<h2>A SQL and JSON inspired DSL</h2>

<p>SQL is quite a powerful DSL to retrieve, filter, project, and join data &#8212; see efforts like
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1961297">A co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared
Data Banks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a>, <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a>, or <a href="http://www.unqlspec.org/">unQL</a> for
examples.</p>

<p>ql.io combines SQL, and JSON into an imperative style <a
href="/docs/lang-overview">language</a>. Scripts written in this language can make HTTP requests to
retrieve data, perform joins between API responses, project responses, or even make requests in
a loop. But note that <em>ql.io's scripting language is not SQL - it is SQL inspired</em>.</p>

<h2>Orchestration</h2>

<p>Most real-world client apps need to mashup data from multiple APIs in one go. Data mashup is
often complicated as client apps need to worry about order of requests, inter-dependencies, error
handling, and parallelization to reduce overall latency.</p>

<p>ql.io's scripts are procedural in appearance but are executed out of order based on dependencies.
Some statements may be scheduled in parallel and some in series based on a dependency analysis done
at script compile time. The compilation is an on-the-fly process.</p>

<h2>Consumer Centric Interfaces</h2>

<p>APIs are designed for reuse, and hence they cater to the common denominator. Getting new fields
added, optimizing responses, or combining multiple requests into one involve drawn out negotiations
between API producing teams and API consuming teams.</p>

<p>ql.io lets API consuming teams move fast by creating consumer-centric interfaces that are
optimized for the client - such optimized interfaces can reduce bandwidth usage and number of HTTP
requests.</p>
